# 🧠 Day -1: Understanding Operating Systems & Linux Basics

## 📌 What is an Operating System (OS)?

- The physical components of a computer—like CPU, memory, and network interface—are called **hardware**.
- Two primary actors want to interact with hardware:
  - **Users**: People like you and me who want to perform tasks (e.g., create folders).
  - **Applications**: Software like YouTube that needs CPU and memory to run.
- Neither users nor applications can directly talk to hardware.
- The **Operating System (OS)** acts as an **intermediate layer** that enables this interaction.

## ⚙️ Why Do We Need an OS?

- OS is a **special software** that knows how to interact with hardware.
- It performs:
  - **Process management**
  - **Memory management**
  - **Network management**
  - **Device management**
- It also provides:
  - **CLI (Command Line Interface)** or
  - **GUI (Graphical User Interface)**  
  so users can interact with the system.

## 🖥️ Popular Operating Systems

- **Windows**
- **macOS**
- **Linux** – widely used in DevOps because it is:
  - **Open-source**
  - **Free to use**
  - **More secure** than others

## 🐧 Linux Architecture Overview

### 🔧 Key Components

| Layer               | Description                                      |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Kernel**          | Core engine of Linux, handles all heavy lifting |
| **System Libraries**| Provide functionality to applications           |
| **CLI (Shell)**     | Interface for users to interact with the system |

### 🧬 Linux Distributions

Since Linux is open-source, many companies build their own versions:

- **Ubuntu**
- **RedHat**
- **Debian**
- **Alpine**
- **Fedora**

## 🛠️ Setting Up Linux on Windows

### ✅ Easiest Ways:

- Use **WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)** to run Linux inside Windows.
- Create an **Ubuntu container** using Docker.

## 📦 Package Management in Linux

### 🧰 What is a Package Manager?

- A tool to **install, update, and remove software**.
- In **Ubuntu**, the package manager is:

```bash
apt
```
